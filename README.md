## Key Academic Project Showcase

This section highlights core projects completed during my Computer Engineering degree. These repositories demonstrate foundational skills in data management, machine learning implementation, and backend development.

**Note on Repository Quality:** These projects were primarily designed under **strict academic deadlines**. While they are fully functional and demonstrate the core logic and solution architecture, some of the underlying code is currently pending refactoring to meet production-level standards for documentation and modularity.

### 1. Large-Scale Data Pipeline: Movie Recommendation System

* **Skills Demonstrated:** Data Wrangling (Pandas), Data Scaling (78M rows), Feature Engineering, SVD++ Implementation.
* **Project Focus:** Designing and implementing a robust data cleaning pipeline to handle large, sparse datasets and improve prediction accuracy by filtering noise.
* **Repository Link:** [View Full Project Details and Architecture](https://github.com/ApplJu1ce/movie-rec-repo/blob/main/README.md)

### 2. Backend & Database System: KU-JATEAW Trip Planning App

* **Skills Demonstrated:** Database Design (MySQL), Backend Development (Node.js), API Implementation, System Integration.
* **Project Focus:** Full-stack collaboration to build a functioning, database-backed mobile application, focusing on efficient data schema design and API communication.
