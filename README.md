## Key Academic Project Showcase

This section highlights core projects completed during my Computer Engineering degree. These repositories demonstrate foundational skills in data management, machine learning implementation, and backend development.

**Note on Repository Quality:** These projects were primarily designed under **strict academic deadlines**. While they are fully functional and demonstrate the core logic and solution, some of the code is currently pending refactoring to meet production-level standards for documentation and modularity.

### 1. Movie Recommendation System

* **Skills:** Data Cleaning using Pandas, Working with small-medium sized data: 78M rows, SVD++ Implementation.
